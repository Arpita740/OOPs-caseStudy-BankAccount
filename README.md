You are developing a Bank Account Management System where the bank has different types of accounts, such as SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount, and Fixed DepositAccount. Each account type has a different way to calculate the interest and withdrawal fee. 

Requirements:

Encapsulate account details like accountid, accountHolderName, and balance in a base class BankAccount.

Create subclasses Savings Account, CurrentAccount, and Fixed DepositAccount. Override a method calculateInterest() and calculateWithdrawal Fee() in each subclass.

Use an abstract class BankAccount with abstract methods for calculating interest and withdrawal fees.

Questions:

Create an abstract BankAccount class with encapsulated fields. Implement subclasses to calculate the specific interest and withdrawal fee for each account type.

Write a main class that creates instances of each account type and calculates their interest and withdrawal fees
